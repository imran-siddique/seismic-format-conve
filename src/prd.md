Geophysicists, seismic processors, and researchers need to modernize their data workflows but are constrained by legacy format dependencies. They require reliable conversion tools that preserve data integrity while providing access to modern storage benefits.

**Critical Path**: 
File Upload → Format Detection → Target Selection → Conversion → Quality Validation → Download

**Key Moments**:
1. **Format Recognition** - Accurate detection builds user confidence
2. **Conversion Progress** - Real-time feedback maintains engagement during processing
3. **Quality Assurance** - Metadata preservation and validation confirms successful conversion
